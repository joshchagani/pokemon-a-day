# 😈 Pokémon a Day

Randomly assigns a Pokémon for the day. The goal is to have the same Pokémon show up for a given day regardless of timezones by using a combination of day, month, and year, to determine the day's pocket monster.

## 🥅 Goals

- Explore state machines (xState)
- Implement unit test

## 📝 Todo

- [ ] This was originally going to use GraphQL to query Pokémon data but I was having issue with the PokeAPI getting sprite info.
